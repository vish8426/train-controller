Train Controller State Machine - Mechatronic State Machine Project

## About
The following project tackles the issue of a small city plagued with human-related errors. That is, the necessity of the introduction of efficient train networks. This report will cover the design and implementation of an efficient state machine to control a train network. This automation concept will be carried out using a model representing the rail system.
