## Overview

The Train Controller State Machine project addresses the challenges faced by small cities plagued with human-related errors in train operations. The core objective is to design and implement an efficient state machine that automates train control, thereby improving reliability and reducing the likelihood of accidents.

## Project Objectives

- Develop a state machine to automate train network operations.
- Reduce human error in train control systems.
- Enhance the efficiency and safety of urban rail transport.
- Implement the system using a model representing the rail network.

## System Architecture

The system is structured around a finite state machine (FSM) that governs train movements based on predefined states and transitions. 

Key components include:â€‹

- **State Definitions**: Represent various operational modes such as idle, moving, stopping, and emergency halt.
- **Transition Conditions**: Define the criteria for moving between states, triggered by inputs like sensor data or timing constraints.
- **Control Logic**: Implements decision-making processes to manage train operations effectively.

## Design Considerations

- **Scalability**: The FSM is designed to accommodate expansion for more complex rail networks.
- **Modularity**: Components are modular to facilitate maintenance and upgrades.
- **Real-Time Operation**: Ensures timely responses to dynamic changes in the train network.
- **Safety Protocols**: Incorporates fail-safes and emergency handling procedures.

## Applications

- **Urban Rail Systems**: Enhancing automation in city train networks.
- **Transportation Research**: Studying the impact of automation on rail safety and efficiency.
- **Educational Tools**: Demonstrating FSM applications in mechatronic engineering.
